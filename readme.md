## MidiBoy

A little Midi Controller with four buttons, four potentiometers and four LEDs. Can be scaled up, feel free to use it as you like.
I also added the schematics I used for this project

You have to install the Bounce 2 And MidiUSB Libraries to make this project work!

This is my first real Arduino project and I'm yet pretty new to Arduino, so **I am open to criticism! :)**
